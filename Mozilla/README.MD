**Project Title**

Universal Web Agent – Browser-Native AI Execution System

**Overview**

The Universal Web Agent is a browser-level AI system that enables users to bring their own AI across websites. Instead of embedding AI inside individual applications, this project treats AI as a browser capability capable of accessing page context, performing actions, and coordinating workflows across sites. The system emphasizes permission-aware execution, user control, scoped authority, and transparent decision boundaries to ensure responsible automation within the browser.

**Objectives**

1) Enable LLM access and tool calling inside the browser

2) Use live page context for intelligent decision-making

3) Execute cross-site workflows autonomously

4) Implement scoped and time-bound permission models

5) Ensure user visibility and control over AI actions

**Core Features**

1) Tiered capability system (LLM → Context → Coordinated Agents)

2) Browser context reading and interaction

3) Cross-site workflow automation

4) Permission-scoped agent execution

5) Action confirmation and preview system

6) Execution logging and auditability

7) Multi-agent coordination layer

**Evaluation Metrics**

1) Clear execution boundaries

2) Thoughtful browser context usage

3) Strong permission design (agent vs task-level control)

4) User legibility and interruptibility

5) Responsible automation and limitation awareness

**Tech Stack (Example)**

Web Agent API SDK, LLM Integration, MCP Tool Calling, Browser Extensions, Multi-Agent Coordination Framework
