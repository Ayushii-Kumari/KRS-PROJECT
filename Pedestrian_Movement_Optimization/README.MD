UrbanFlow – Agentic AI for Pedestrian Movement Optimization

Project Explanation

UrbanFlow is an agentic AI-based smart city system designed to monitor and optimize pedestrian movement in crowded public spaces such as campuses, railway stations, malls, stadiums, and event venues. The system uses data from cameras, sensors, or footfall counters to continuously observe pedestrian density, movement speed, and crowd flow patterns.
Instead of only analyzing data, UrbanFlow uses autonomous AI agents to reason and take decisions in real time. These agents detect congestion, overcrowding, or unsafe movement patterns and independently decide corrective actions such as suggesting alternate routes, redirecting crowd flow, adjusting entry/exit points, or issuing alerts during peak hours or emergencies.
The system’s goal is to reduce crowd congestion, prevent accidents, and improve overall pedestrian safety and comfort without requiring constant human supervision.
