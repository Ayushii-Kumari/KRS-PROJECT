CallPilot – Autonomous Voice AI Appointment Scheduler

**Overview**

CallPilot is an agentic voice AI system that autonomously calls service providers, negotiates appointment slots, and books the optimal match based on user preferences. Powered by ElevenLabs conversational AI and tool-calling capabilities, the system can orchestrate multiple parallel calls, analyze availability, check calendar conflicts, and rank providers using a scoring function. CallPilot transforms traditional phone-based appointment booking into an automated, intelligent decision-making process.
