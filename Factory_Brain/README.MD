**Project Title**

FactoryBrain – Autonomous Production Optimization Agent

**Overview**

FactoryBrain is an intermediate-level agentic AI system designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize factory production workflows with minimal human intervention. The system collects real-time and historical operational data such as machine utilization, production rate, idle time, energy consumption, and defect levels to evaluate overall factory performance.

Unlike traditional dashboards that only visualize metrics, FactoryBrain uses coordinated AI modules to detect bottlenecks, workload imbalances, abnormal production patterns, and early maintenance risks. Based on its analysis, the system intelligently recommends and simulates workflow adjustments such as task reallocation between machines, production sequence optimization, load balancing, and preventive maintenance scheduling.

The system follows an Observe → Analyze → Decide → Act → Evaluate loop to continuously improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime.

**Objectives**

1) Monitor machine-level performance metrics in real time

2) Detect production bottlenecks and inefficiencies
