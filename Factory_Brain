Autonomous Production Optimization Agent is an agentic AI system designed to intelligently monitor and optimize factory operations without human intervention. The system continuously collects real-time and historical data such as machine utilization, production rates, idle time, energy consumption, and defect levels to understand overall operational efficiency. Using multiple coordinated AI agents, FactoryBrain analyzes this data to detect bottlenecks, inefficiencies, abnormal patterns, and maintenance risks within the production workflow. Based on its analysis, the system autonomously makes and executes optimization decisions—such as reallocating tasks between machines, adjusting production sequences, balancing workloads, or scheduling preventive maintenance. By continuously observing, reasoning, acting, and learning from outcomes, FactoryBrain aims to maximize productivity, reduce downtime, minimize resource waste, and create a smarter, self-optimizing factory environment.
