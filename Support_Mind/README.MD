**Project Title**

SupportMind – Self-Learning Support Intelligence System

**Overview**
SupportMind is an AI-powered self-learning support intelligence system designed to improve customer support quality, compliance, and operational efficiency. The system continuously analyzes support conversations, tickets, scripts, and knowledge base articles to extract insights and update institutional knowledge automatically. Instead of relying on static documentation and manual QA processes, SupportMind creates a dynamic intelligence layer that learns from every customer interaction and embeds trust into support workflows.

**Objectives**

1) Automatically generate and update knowledge articles from resolved cases

2) Improve retrieval accuracy using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

3) Provide structured QA scoring for support interactions

4) Ensure compliance and safety through guardrail detection

5) Maintain traceability between knowledge articles and source tickets

**Core Features**

1) Self-Updating Knowledge Engine with versioning

2) AI-powered Support Coaching Agent

3) Compliance & Safety Guardrail Detection

4) Live Agent Copilot for real-time suggestions

5) Root Cause Mining for recurring product issues

6) Knowledge Quality Dashboard with scoring metrics

7) Traceability using explicit KB lineage mapping

**Evaluation Metrics**

1) Retrieval accuracy (hit@k using ground truth IDs)

2) Knowledge update traceability

3) QA scoring consistency

4) Compliance detection effectiveness

5) Demonstrated self-learning feedback loop

**Tech Stack (Example)**

Python, FastAPI, LLM APIs, Vector Database, RAG Pipeline, Structured JSON Evaluation, Multi-Agent Orchestration
