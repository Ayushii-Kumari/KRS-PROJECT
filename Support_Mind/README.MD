RealPage – Self-Learning Support AI (SupportMind)

*Project Title*
SupportMind – Self-Learning Support Intelligence System

*Overview*
SupportMind is an AI-powered self-learning support intelligence system designed to improve customer support quality, compliance, and operational efficiency. The system continuously analyzes support conversations, tickets, scripts, and knowledge base articles to extract insights and update institutional knowledge automatically. Instead of relying on static documentation and manual QA processes, SupportMind creates a dynamic intelligence layer that learns from every customer interaction and embeds trust into support workflows.
